@(#)READWIN.txt	1.3	00/01/04 Connectathon Testsuite

Certain tests do not run in the DOS/Windows environmant, due to
limitations or implementation differences between DOS and Unix:

            dupreq
            fstat
            nfsidem
	    op_ren (open-rename)
            rewind
            truncate

Also, the following tests do not appear to run under Windows, though
they do appear to run under DOS:

	    negseek

The following tests have not been ported to DOS or Windows because
nobody has tried:

	    telldir
	    bigfile
	    bigfile2
	    freesp
